abstract = {Optomechanical systems provide a means for studying and controlling quantum effects in the motion of macroscopic objects. To date, quantum optomechanical effects have been studied in objects made from solids and gases. Here we describe measurements of quantum behavior in the vibrations of a liquid body. Specifically, we monitor the fluctuations of an individual acoustic standing wave in superfluid liquid helium, and find that it displays the characteristic signatures of zero-point motion and measurement back-action. This opens the possibility of exploiting the properties of liquids in general (and superfluid helium in particular) to access qualitatively new regimes of quantum optomechanics.},

abstract = {Statistical Methods in Quantum Optics 2 - Non-Classical Fields continues the development of the methods used in quantum optics to treat open quantum systems and their fluctuations. Its early chapters build upon the phase-space methods introduced in the first volume Statistical Methods in Quantum Optics 1 - Matter Equations and Fokker-Planck Equations: the difficulties these methods face in treating non-classical light are exposed, where the regime of large fluctuations – failure of the system size expansion – is shown to be particularly problematic. Cavity QED is adopted as a natural vehicle for extending quantum noise theory into this regime. In response to the issues raised, the theory of quantum trajectories is presented as a universal approach to the treatment of fluctuations in open quantum systems. This book presents its material at a level suitable for beginning researchers or students in an advanced course in quantum optics, or a course in quantum mechanics or statistical physics that deals with open quantum systems. The text is complemented by exercises and interspersed notes that point the reader to side issues or a deeper exploration of the material presented.},

abstract = {Various probability distributions are calculated for photocurrent fluctuations for photoelectric detection and are expressed in terms of quantum averages of field operators. The calculation is based on an extended theory of Kelley and Kleiner for photoelectric counting [Phys. Rev. 136, A316 (1963)], which allows us to obtain the counting distributions for multiple time intervals and multiple detectors. The finite duration of the detector's response function is also considered in our formalism, as is the possibility of fluctuations in the response function itself. This generalized theory is applied to homodyne and heterodyne detection processes. We find that with ideal conditions (perfectly balanced detectors with unit quantum efficiency), the characteristic function of the photocurrent fluctuations from homodyne detection is connected to the Fourier transformation of the Wigner function of a single-mode field, while that from heterodyne detection is linked to the antinormally ordered characteristic function of the field. More specifically, if the two orthogonal quadratures of the photocurrent are recorded in the heterodyne detection, the joint probability distribution for the two quadratures is simply the Q function of the field without the need for optical tomography. Our formalism is applied to the multimode case and allows one to draw important conclusions about the possibility of measurements of the complete quantum state of a multimode field. In particular, the complete characterization of fields with intermode correlations is a nontrivial undertaking, as we demonstrate with our general formalism as well as by specific examples.},

@article{Borkje2016,
abstract = {We consider a system where an optical cavity mode is parametrically coupled to a mechanical oscillator. A laser beam driving the cavity at its resonance frequency will acquire red- and blue-shifted sidebands due to noise in the position of the mechanical oscillator. In a classical theory without noise in the electromagnetic field, the powers of these sidebands are of equal magnitude. In a quantum theory, however, an asymmetry between the sidebands can be resolved when the oscillator's average number of vibrational excitations (phonons) becomes small, i.e., comparable to 1. We discuss the interpretation of this sideband asymmetry in a heterodyne photodetection measurement scheme and show that it depends on the choice of detector model. In the optical regime, standard photodetection theory leads to a photocurrent noise spectrum given by normal and time ordered expectation values. The sideband asymmetry is in that case a direct reflection of the quantum asymmetry of the position noise spectrum of the mechanical oscillator. Conversely, for a detector that measures symmetric, non-ordered expectation values, we show that the sideband asymmetry can be traced back to quantum optomechanical interference terms. This ambiguity in interpretation applies not only to mechanical oscillators, but to any degree of freedom that couples linearly to noise in the electromagnetic field. Finally, we also compare the quantum theory to a fully classical model, where sideband asymmetry can arise from classical optomechanical interference terms. We show that, due to the oscillator's lack of zero point motion in a classical theory, the sidebands in the photocurrent spectrum differ qualitatively from those of a quantum theory at sufficiently low temperatures. We discuss the observable consequences of this deviaton between classical and quantum theories.},

abstract = {The detection of squeezed optical fields generated by intracavity nonlinear-optical interactions is described. The relationship between quantum-statistical properties of the cavity mode and those of the field at a detector placed outside the cavity discussed. The detected field is composed of a source field from the cavity plus a free external field. The free field couples weakly to the cavity so that it is correlated with the source field. The photocurrent spectrum in optical homodyne detection is calculated, and the spectrum of squeezing is defined. This spectrum can be calculated entirely in terms of intracavity fields without requiring knowledge of the correlations between source and free-field contributions in the cavity output. This follows from an explicitly normally ordered, time-ordered treatment of the photodetection problem. Contrasting earlier treatments of photodetection for squeezed fields, in a normally ordered approach, shot noise arises naturally from the self-correlation of photocurrent for pulses. The derived spectrum is converted into nonnormally ordered, non-time-ordered form to recover the results of these earlier treatments and their interpretation of shot noise in terms of local-oscillator quantum noise, signal and quantum noise, and detector-efficiency quantum noise.},

abstract = {A theory of electromagnetic field measurement by means of photoionization is developed and applied to photoelectron counting. A probability theory involving multitime joint probability functions for a sequence of photoionizations is formulated. A general quantum-theory definition is proposed for the nonexclusive probability function which occurs in the probability theory. Approximations are then introduced to derive expressions for this probability function which involve correlation functions of the photoionization detector and the electromagnetic field-plus-source. The general theory is used to derive quantities of interest in photo-ionization counting experiments. Expressions are derived for (1) the probability Pn(t, t+T) that n photo-ionizations are observed in the time interval t to t+T, and (2) quantities related to Pn(t, t+T), such as its generating function and various moments. Pn(t, t+T) is found to be a compound Poisson distribution determined by the density operator of the field when the latter is expressed in Glauber's P representation. Using this result, the character of Pn(t, t+T) is examined for several specific density operators. These correspond to a coherent state, various fields with the mode phases distributed independently of the mode amplitudes, and a "spread-out" coherent state.},

abstract = {The concept of coherence which has conventionally been used in optics is found to be inadequate to the needs of recently opened areas of experiment. To provide a fuller discussion of coherence, a succession of correlation functions for the complex 6eld strengths is de6ned. The nth order function expresses the correla- tion of values of the fields at 2n different points of space and time. Certain values of these functions are measurable by means of n-fold delayed coincidence detection of photons. A fully coherent field is defined as one whose correlation functions satisfy an in6nite succession of stated conditions. Various orders of incomplete coherence are distinguished, according to the number of coherence conditions actually satis6ed. It is noted that the 6elds historically described as coherent in optics have only first-order coherence. On the other hand, the existence, in principle, of 6elds coherent to all orders is shown both in quantum theory and classical theory. The methods used in these discussions apply to fields of arbitrary time dependence. It is shown, as a result, that coherence does not require monochromaticity. Coherent fields can be generated with arbitrary spectra.},

abstract = {We develop a formulation of quantum damping theory in which the explicit nature of inputs from a heat bath, and of outputs into it, is taken into account. Quantum Langevin equations are developed, in which the Langevin forces are the field operators corresponding to the input modes. Time-reversed equations exist in which the Langevin forces are the output modes, and the sign of damping is reversed. Causality and boundary conditions relating inputs to system variables are developed. The concept of ‘‘quantum white noise'' is formulated, and the formal relationship between quantum Langevin equations and quantum stochastic differential equations (SDE's) is established. In analogy to the classical formulation, there are two kinds of SDE's: the Ito and the Stratonovich forms. Rules are developed for converting from one to the other. These rules depend on the nature of the quantum white noise, which may be squeezed. The SDE's developed are shown to be exactly equivalent to quantum master equations, and rules are developed for computing multitime-ordered correlation functions with use of the appropriate master equation. With use of the causality and boundary conditions, the relationship between correlation functions of the output and those of the system and the input is developed. It is possible to calculate what kind of output statistics result, provided that one knows the input statistics and provided that one can compute the system correlation functions.},
