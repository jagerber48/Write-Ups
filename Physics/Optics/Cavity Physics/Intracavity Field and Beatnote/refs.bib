abstract = {We present a simple and intuitive model based on the impulse response of linear electrical systems for describing the propagation of optical pulses through a dynamic Fabry?Perot resonator whose refractive index changes with time. Our model shows that the adiabatic wavelength conversion process in resonators results from a scaling of the round-trip time with index changes. For pulses longer than the cavity round-trip time, we find that more energy can be transferred to the new wavelength when the input pulses are slightly detuned from the cavity resonance and the refractive index does not change too rapidly. In fact, the optimum duration of index changes scales with the photon lifetime of the resonator. We describe the evolution of the shape and spectrum of picosecond pulses inside a resonator under a variety of input conditions and with the magnitude and duration of index variations. We also apply our general theory to the case of pulses whose widths are shorter than the round-trip time and derive an analytical expression for the output field under quite general conditions. This analysis reveals a shifting of the spectral comb as well as compression of the temporal pulse train that depends on the both the magnitude and sign of the index change. Our results should find applications in the area of optical signal processing using resonant photonic structures.},

@article{Uphoff2015,
abstract = {We study the frequency splitting of the polarization eigenmodes of the fundamental transverse mode in CO2 laser-machined, high-finesse optical Fabry-Perot cavities and investigate the influence of the geometry of the cavity mirrors. Their highly reflective surfaces are typically not rotationally symmetric but have slightly different radii of curvature along two principal axes. We observe that the eccentricity of such elliptical mirrors lifts the degeneracy of the polarization eigenmodes. The impact of the eccentricity increases for smaller radii of curvature. A model derived from corrections to the paraxial resonator theory is in excellent agreement with the measurements, showing that geometric effects are the main source of the frequency splitting of polarization modes for the type of microscopic cavity studied here. By rotating one of the mirrors around the cavity axis, the splitting can be tuned. In the case of an identical differential phase shift per mirror, it can even be eliminated, despite a nonvanishing eccentricity of each mirror. We expect our results to have important implications for many experiments in cavity quantum electrodynamics, where Fabry-Perot cavities with small mode volumes are required.},
